# Chess Engine

A lightweight chess engine implemented from scratch in C++ for a Kaggle competition with **extreme memory constraints (~300 KB binary size)**.  
The focus of this project was not to rival modern engines like Stockfish, but to design a **functional, optimized engine** that can generate legal moves, search variations, and evaluate positions under strict memory and performance limits.
